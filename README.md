# Website Project:: Portfolio

This is a website created for CFA Sydney bootcamp â€“ term 1. The brief for this project is the following:
  - Create a website for personal portfolio using skills learnt to date: css, html, a bit of rails
  - Build prototype that can be expanded further to include new portfolio items
  - Need to have thoughtfully written bio
  - Need to have portfolio section of coding-related projects
