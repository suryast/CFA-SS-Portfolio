# Website Project:: Portfolio

Preview can be found on <http://cfa-ss-portfolio.herokuapp.com> – this project will be regularly updated and moved to <http://setiyaputra.me>

This is a website created for CFA Sydney bootcamp – term 1\. The brief for this project is the following:
- Create a website for personal portfolio using skills learnt to date: css, html, a bit of rails
- Build prototype that can be expanded further to include new portfolio items
- Need to have thoughtfully written bio
- Need to have portfolio section of coding-related projects
- Need to have a link for contacting owner of the page
- Need to show characters of the creator

# Approach:

My goal was to build the website mobile first and practising the usage of css to create fully responsive website. This was the first time I had to do thi.

I had chosen to use Zurb Foundation's css framework. Foundation can be downloaded [here](https://foundation.zurb.com).

I focused on playing around with media size and creating layout that transform as the website gets resized or viewed using different devices – with some interactive typed.js scripts <http://www.mattboldt.com/demos/typed-js/>

## Tech

The website uses the following requirements to work properly:

- [Rails v.5](https://www.rubyonrails.org) - Ruby on Rails
- [Foundation](https://foundation.zurb.com) - css framework
- [Typed.js](http://www.mattboldt.com/demos/typed-js/) - simple javascript for typing effect

## Roadblocks

- Building this website using rails framework is not ideal
- Javascripts are not working in the deployed version of the website

## Todos

- Create content cards to show portfolio
- Rebuild using React.js
- Replace Foundation css with something more friendly and mobile ready like Bulma
